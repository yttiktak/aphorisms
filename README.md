# aphorisms
For histeric historic reasons, explain:

Relied on node.js and a bitcoind running an rpc. 
The idea was to serve digital encrypted content (an svg 'stream') in synchrony with 
'confirmations' of a bitcoin transaction.

The svg content was hand written aphorisms, such as 'you never can tell' etc.
